ABSTRACT={Projection mapping alters the visual appearance of objects by projecting images onto their surfaces. Traditionally, its application has been limited to dark environments because the contrast of the projected image diminishes in environmental lighting. This often results in the target appearing self-luminous, creating a perceptually unnatural effect. Recently, however, projection systems have been developed that maintain high contrast even in well-lit environments. Studies have shown that projections in bright rooms can shift perception from an appearance of self-luminosity to one of being illuminated. This advancement holds significant promise for applications that require visual naturalness, such as product design. Nonetheless, the influence of projected content on perception and the underlying mechanisms of perceptual color transitions in projection targets remain unclear. In this study, we found that the presence or absence of patterns in the projected content affects the luminosity threshold at which the projection target is perceived as self-luminous. Previous research in perception has suggested that the visual system relies on intrinsic criteria to determine whether an object is self-luminous. However, our results revealed that in projection mapping, the internal reference for color perception, developed through observations of colors in daily life, does not always apply. These results indicate the existence of perceptual phenomena unique to projection mapping. This insight is crucial for product design, as it aims to achieve representations that closely resemble the appearance of real-world objects.}}

  abstract={Projection mapping (PM) is a technique that enhances the appearance of real-world surfaces using projected images, enabling multiple people to view augmentations simultaneously, thereby facilitating communication and collaboration. However, PM typically requires a dark environment to achieve high-quality projections, limiting its practicality. In this paper, we overcome this limitation by replacing conventional room lighting with heterogeneous projectors. These projectors replicate environmental lighting by selectively illuminating the scene, excluding the projection target. Our contributions include a distributed projector optimization framework designed to effectively replicate environmental lighting and the incorporation of a large-aperture projector, in addition to standard projectors, to reduce high-luminance emitted rays and hard shadows-undesirable factors for collaborative tasks in PM. We conducted a series of quantitative and qualitative experiments, including user studies, to validate our approach. Our findings demonstrate t hat our projector-based lighting system significantly enhancesthe contrast and realism of PM results even under e nvironmental lighting compared to typical lights. Furthermore, our method facilitates a substantial shift in the perceived color mode from the undesirable aperture-color mode, where observers perceive the projected object as self-luminous, to the surface-color mode in PM.},

  abstract={Projection mapping (PM) in a bright room creates the problem of reducing the contrast of the projected texture because ambient lighting elevates the black level of the projection target. In this paper, we developed a pseudo-ambient lighting technique that turns off the original ambient lighting and reproduces its illumination from the projectors on surfaces other than the target. We confirmed that the proposed technique could reproduce a bright room while suppressing the contrast reduction of the projected texture on the target, which helped to improve the viewing experience.},
